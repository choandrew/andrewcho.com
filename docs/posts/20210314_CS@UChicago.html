    <h1>CS @ UChicago</h1>
    <div class="main">
        <p>
            I had a pretty good experience with the CS department at UChicago, so I would like to share my experience.
            I did the Computational and Applied Math major, which required me to take the intro sequence + discrete math
            + algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
            I took the 160s "Honors" Sequence, where we learned Haskell for the first quarter. I would say that learning
            a functional language was well worth the effort.
            If any first or second year at UChicago is having doubts about whether they should take the 150s or 160s, I
            would say that if you have a decently strong math background and some CS experience, then it is worth
            taking. You will definitely need to work hard though, and I would definitely recommend finding a good
            partner to work with.
            Beyond the content, I also think that the people you meet will be the more ambitious and driven types, so it
            will be good to meet people in the class.
        </p>
        <p>
            162 (we learned C), 154 (computer systems), Discrete math + algorithms were pretty textbook (but good) in
            terms of their content.
        </p>
        <p>
            All in all, the CS classes I took were definitely some of my favorite, and I would highly recommend taking
            the honors version if you can handle it.
        </p>

    <h1>The Attention Economy</h1>
    <div class="main">
        <p>
        There is a terrible trend on YouTube that has been building for a bit: content creators just yapping and making informational videos much longer than necessary.
        <br>
        One terrible offender of this is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/linustechtips">LinusTechTips</a>. I used to occassionally watch his videos, but now it seems that 
        he has to use more clickbait titles and have yappier videos to continue to support his larger team and higher production value.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is no coincidence that all of his videos are over 10 minutes long - 
        long form videos are better monetizable for the creator through more space for ads (both embedded in video and out of video - 
        would highly recommend <a href="https://sponsor.ajay.app/">SponsorBlock</a> for the embedded ads). 
        YouTube values and thus monetarily rewards the higher engagement in the long-form videos.
        <br>
        However, from the perspective of useful information density, this incentive system encourages adding a ton of fluff to the videos to extend the length.
        <br>
        For many videos, one would legitimately be able to get 70% of the value of the video in a 1 minute summary, but a creator would never do so, because it would make them less money.
        <br>
        For example, this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwdDAZruMKk">Your Internet is Too Fast</a>.
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.summarize.tech/www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwdDAZruMKk">
            <img src="photos/20240430_Attention/summary.png" width="980" alt="screenshot of summary of video"></a>
        <br>
        Using this random AI summary website, we can see parse this information so much faster in way less time (although it will miss any important charts). 
        It would be even faster if the script were actually written in an information dense way.
        </p>

        <p>
            This does seem like a potentially temporary issue, because it seems that AI summarization will get better. 
            One question for the future is, how will these knowledge aggregators (who get paid in terms of engagement) get paid in the future? 
            Also, on the other end, I see this with any short form content - just blatantly wrong information being shown in very short form content (IG reels or YouTube Shorts.)
            The ones that are too short seem to have a lot of blatant overgeneralizations.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a side note, I would like to write more blog posts.
            <br>
            My desire for perfection and to put out only thoughts that I think no one else has written out before has stopped me from writing more, 
            so I will try not to not be as perfectionist. As the saying goes, perfect is the enemy of good.

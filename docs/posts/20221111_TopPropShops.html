    <h1>Top Trading Firms in the Industry</h1>
    <div class="main">
        <p>
            Why am I making this post?
            Partially because I want to remove this from my notes, but still wanted to have this as a reference
            somewhere. Partially because I think all of the information online on forums like WallStreetOasis is
            straight garbage and outdated. I want to give an informed opinion by a non-anonymous person in the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, a bunch of caveats.
            For the sake of not instigating, this list is unranked, although I do have a sort of ranking in my head.
            <br>
            Does this mean that if you are not working at one of these firms, I am claiming that you suck or are not
            making any money? Definitely not. There are people I have heard at trading firms not on this list who make
            multiple 8 figures a year, which could very likely be way more than I might ever make (although hopefully
            not!). There are likely smaller trading firms that I am missing with awesome people that I am unaware of.
            Also, even at trading firms that are overall not great, there are desks that print money.
            I, for one, am joining a firm that not as many people have heard of and I am not putting on this list.
        </p>
        <p>
            This list will be most useful for new and recent grads. For experienced experienced hire (eg trying to start
            a desk), this list would still be relevant, but generally an experienced hire would have additional
            concerns. I define a "top" trading firm as one with very good management and trading, very
            profitable desks, and most importantly give the most competitive total compensation to a new grad or a
            recent grad (these are all highly correlated).

            A good benchmark for the total compensation for a new grad is over the numeric value of the 25914th prime in
            USD. The very top new grad offers I have heard of are slightly over double this number.
            These numbers are generally reserved for people who got a return offer at the most competitive firms
            and also got competing offers.

    <h1>"Why Are There So Many Shitty Men in NYC"</h1>
    <div class="main">
        <p>
            Many of my female friends in NY claim that there are so many shitty men on these dating apps.
            However, anecdotally, I would say that all of my male friends are not shitty.
        </p>
        <p>
            I spent a while trying to make a model of how this is possible, and I think it comes down to a couple of
            reasons:
        <ul>
            <li>Dating apps allow for bad behavior due to one-shot interactions that allow for anti-social</li>
            <li>bad behavior "superspreaders"</li>
            <li>Top 80% of women compete for the top 20% of men on dating apps</li>
            <li>lack of clarity / miscommunication in the goal of the relationship</li>
            <li>high quality people who are seeking relationships tend to drop out of the dating pool over time (people
                who are "good" at monogamy")</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            For fun, I thought I'd make a simple model of

            One thing I have anecdotally noticed is that being less status oriented someone is extremely conducive
            toward long lasting relationships.

        </p>

        <p>
            I don't really have any easy proposed solution for this. Maybe Hinge can implement some sort of review
            system on people.

    <h1>Reflections on A 1 Year Noncompete</h1>
    <div class="main">
        <p>
            1. Health insurance is expensive
            2. Traveling for long periods of times wore down on me and also any health problems become way more
            difficult to solve as getting to a doctor in a foreign country can be difficult
            3. I did not get as much done as I had wanted to because I played poker and chess
            4.

            I personally wanted to be near my friends and family.

    <h1>Trading Firms Don't Make The Most Edge Per Trade</h1>
    <div class="main">
        <p>
            First, a reference to another article: <a
                href="https://robkhenderson.substack.com/p/the-perils-of-imitating-high-status">Be Wary of Imitating
                High-Status People Who Can Afford to Countersignal</a>

            I think the above article was the best article I've read in recent memory.
            Side note: The writer is probably the best example of a right-leaning (my description, he might disagree)
            writer.

            For something that is supposedly luxury, it is insane to me that this <a
                href="https://youtu.be/kYjIblqg7SU?t=712">$1600 Louis Vuitton bag</a> costs $110 in material + labor
            costs.
            That is almost $1500 of guaranteed profit, a 93% margin.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nerds at trading firms are out here fighting each other over pennies in theoretical edge and getting
            adversely selected, while LVMH is <b>locking in</b> thousands per unit, despite there being superfakes that
            authenticators cannot distinguish from the real bags unless they can scan the built in RFID chips.

            The existence for the need of the RFID chip for authentication essentially proves that the superfakes are so
            accurate that they are impossible to tell apart. All that RFID is proving is that someone has given an
            insane amount of edge to whatever "luxury" brand they chose.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's widely studied in psychology and marketing as to why people buy from these brands(<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_consumption">conspicuous consumption</a>, clout chasing,
            status-seeking, "lifestyle"), so I won't explain why. All I can say is that instead of "Flash Boys: A Wall
            Street Revolt", Michael Lewis should've wrote "Flashy Boys: A Clout Chasing Scam"

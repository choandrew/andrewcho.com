    <h1>Trading Firms Don't Make The Most Edge Per Trade</h1>
    <div class="main">
        <p>
            First, a reference to another article: <a
                href="https://robkhenderson.substack.com/p/the-perils-of-imitating-high-status">Be Wary of Imitating
                High-Status People Who Can Afford to Countersignal</a>

            I think the above article was the best article I've read in recent memory.
            Side note: The writer is probably the best example of a right-leaning (my description, he might disagree)
            writer.

            For something that is supposedly luxury, it is insane to me that this <a
                href="https://youtu.be/kYjIblqg7SU?t=712">$1600 Louis Vuitton bag</a> costs $110 in material + labor
            costs.
            That is almost $1500 of guaranteed profit, a 93% margin.

            Nerds at trading firms are out here fighting each other over pennies in theoretical edge and getting
            adversely
            selected, while LVMH is <b>locking in</b> thousands per unit.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's widely studied in psychology and marketing as to why people buy from these brands(<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_consumption">conspicuous consumption</a>, clout chasing,
            status-seeking, "lifestyle"), so I won't explain why. All I can say is that instead of "Flash Boys: A Wall
            Street Revolt", Michael Lewis should've wrote "Flashy Boys: A Clout Chasing Scam"

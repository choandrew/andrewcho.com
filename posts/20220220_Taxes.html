        <p>
            I have decided to write a high level overview I was forced to become familiar with over the past 3 years:
            <br>
            US government incentivized ways to minimize taxes (as of 2022).
        </p>
        <p>
            This blog will probably be most helpful to someone who is unfamiliar with these tax deductions, has the ability to save a couple tens of thousands a year, and wants to avoid taxes. 
            My imagined demographic reading this is a tech worker or someone in the financial industries.
            The savings per year compound and can have an effect in the low hundreds of thousands by retirement assuming you start in early 20s. 
            <br>
            <strong>DISCLAIMER: This is not financial advice and you should do your own research. Think for yourself.</strong>
            <br>
            I personally hate how complicated this is, and how you forgo so much money if you miss these opportunities. 
            This complication might be why there are so many "financial gurus" who mislead the uninformed public and profit so much from them.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are 4 accounts that are common and relatively easy to open that I will discuss:
            <strong>HSA, 401k, IRA, 529</strong>
        </p>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
            <table>
                <col width="20px" />
                <tr>
                  <td></td>
                  <td>HSA</td>
                  <td>Trad. 401k</td>
                  <td>Roth 401k</td>
                  <td>Trad. IRA</td>
                  <td>Roth IRA</td>
                  <td>529</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Pre-Tax</td>

                  <td>✔</td>
                </tr>
            </table> 
            <ul>
              <li>Pre-Tax: The money going into an account has not been taxed, i.e. no income tax</li>
              <li>Post-Tax: The gains in the account are not taxed when withdrawn from the account, i.e. no capital gains</li>
              <li>Traditional: is pre-tax, is not post-tax</li>
              <li>Roth: is not pre-tax, is post-tax</li>
              <li>Investments that are not post-tax free are taxed at and add to an individual's income tax rate at the time of withdrawal.
                  If you are truly retired, you presumably have no other source of income, so these withdrawals would be your only income.
              </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Some things to note:
            <ul>
            <li>As long as the money is in the tax-advantaged account, any gains will be tax free. It is only when you start withdrawing that there may be tax implications.</li>
            <li>For the retirements accounts (401K, IRA) early withdrawal fees before you reach "retirement age" (generally over 65, although this will likely increase)</li>
            </ul>
            
        </p>

        <h2>HSA</h2>
        <p>
            HSA is short for Health Savings Account.
            The intended purposes of this account is actually as a pre-tax account that is only allowed to spend money on healthcare related items.
            However, one might be better served by simply not saving it and instead, investing, because 
            <strong>this is technically the most tax advantaged account </strong> that I know of as it is both pre-tax and post-tax free.
            Once the owner of the account reaches age 65, it becomes like a regular retirement account that you own, and you can withdraw money out of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            One can only open this if you have an High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP, as hinted at by the name, a plan with a high deductible as opposed to a PPO plan).
            If you are in your 20s with no dependents and are healthy, then it might be a good idea.
            <br>
            One can calculate the breakeven point between a PPO account and a HDHP pretty easily, and once you hit the deductible for the HDHP, these accounts seem to be equivalent.

            As of 2022, one can only contribute $3650, so it is not a huge account though.
        </p>


        <h2>401K</h2>
        <p>
            401Ks are attached to employment for some god-forsaken reason. If you leave your employment, you can (and maybe should) transfer this money into an IRA.
        	No access until minimum age 55, although there are major easily Google-able exceptions such as the Substantially Equal Periodic Payment (SEPP) exception.
        </p>
        <p>
             When you convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, you will owe taxes on any money in the traditional IRA that would have been taxed when you withdrew it.
             That includes the tax-deductible contributions you made to the account as well as the tax-deferred earnings that have built up in it over the years.
             That money will be taxed as income in the year you make the conversion.

        </p>

        <h2>IRA</h2>
        <p>
            If you make six-figures, you likely cannot directly contribute to any IRA. However, the backdoor roth IRA allows contributions.
        	No access until minimum age 59.5, although there are major easily Google-able exceptions such as the Substantially Equal Periodic Payment (SEPP) exception.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Another important note is that you can convert pieces of a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA at any time.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>529</h2>
        <p>
            This is account is only applicable if you have a family member going to school in the future.
            <a href="https://support.wealthfront.com/hc/en-us/articles/214676123-Can-I-use-a-529-account-to-save-for-a-child-who-hasn-t-been-born-yet-">
                This can include unborn children</a> (although one should pore over the tax implications).

            <ul>
        	<li>Contributions can be state income tax-deductible (e.g. in Illinois, contributions lead to a tax reimbursement up to $500)</li>
        	<li>
                Money can come out tax free at any time as long as you spend it on "educational costs"
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>"educational costs" is a very broad category. This can include purchases such as laptops.</li>
            </ul>
        	<li>One can contribute 15k before gift tax</li>
        	<li>One can switch beneficiaries tax free, although there are federal gift tax consequences</li>
            </ul>

        </p>

        <h2>Some Additional Helpful Info</h2>
        <p>
            There is a common misconception that ETFs are strictly better/cheaper than mutual funds. Some mutual fund benefits:
            <ul>
            <li>One does not need to worry about execution (granted, you can only execute at EOD)</li>
            <li>Dividend ReInvestment Programs (DRIPs) automatically reinvest your mutual fund dividends</li>
            <li>One can convert mutual fund shares into ETF shares tax free (although not vice-versa)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a misconception that mutual funds also always have more taxes, but firms like <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/how-vanguard-patented-a-system-to-avoid-taxes-in-mutual-funds-4686985"> Vanguard uses "heartbeat" trades</a>
            to reduce taxes on trades (Granted, <a href="https://archive.md/WblOS"> they can't avoid all taxes</a>).
            Vanguard has many funds with both mutual fund classes and an ETF class, and for the purposes of a retirement account that does not have to deal with these taxes, ETFs and mutual funds are very close.
        </p>

        <h3>Vanguard Example Fund</h3>
        <p>
        VTSAX is a fund that is "designed to provide investors with exposure to the entire U.S. equity market".
        The below image depicts the different classes of the same fund.
        <br>
        <a href="https://institutional.vanguard.com/investments/product-details/fund/0855">
        <img src="photos/20220220_Taxes/vanguard.PNG">
        </a>
        <br>
        One can see that if you have "institutional" level money (ie $5M), the mutual fund is actually cheaper than the ETF, so if you have $5M invested, you should just do the institutional level.

        The mutual fund with the lowest minimum is VTSAX, which has 4 basis points of fees a year, while the equivalent ETF VTI has 3 basis points of fees a year.
        If you have 1 million dollars, this will be an additional $100 of fees a year, so it will be a trade-off between DRIP and the extra bp in fees.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        One should keep in mind the tax efficiency of the products traded as well (e.g. bonds are not very tax efficient).

        <p>
            I have decided to write about a topic I was forced to become familiar with over the past 3 years:

            US taxes and US government incentivized ways to minimize them.
        </p>
        <p>
            This blog will probably be most helpful to someone who is unfamiliar with these tax deductions, saving in the tens of thousands a year, and wants to avoid taxes. 
            The savings per year compound and can have an effect in the low hundreds of thousands by retirement assuming you start in early 20s. 
            <strong>DISCLAIMER: This is not financial advice, and you should do your own research before opening any of these accounts.</strong>
            I personally hate how complicated this is, and how you forgo so much money if you miss these opportunities. 
            This complication might be why there are so many "financial gurus" who mislead the uninformed public and profit so much from them.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you see any error in what I said, please email and I will correct. 
            Otherwise, do not email me asking for advice, I will not answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are 4 accounts that are common and relatively easy to open that I will discuss:
            HSA, 401k, IRA, 529
        </p>
        <p>
            Some vocab:
            <ul>
              <li>Pre-Tax</li>
              <li>After-Tax</li>
              <li>Milk</li>
            </ul>         
        </p>

        <p>
            A summary for you:
            <table>
                <tr>
                  <td></td>
                  <td>HSA</td>
                  <td>Trad. 401k</td>
                  <td>Roth 401k</td>
                  <td>Trad. IRA</td>
                  <td>Roth IRA</td>
                  <td>529</td>
                </tr>
                  <td>Deposit</td>
                <tr>
                </tr>
                  <td>Withdrawal</td>
                <tr>
                </tr>
            </table> 

            One thing to note is that <strong>as long as the money is in the tax-advantaged account, any gains will be tax free</strong>.
            It is only when you start withdrawing that there may be tax implications.
        </p>
        <p>
            HSA: can only open this if you have an High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP, as hinted at by the name, a plan with a high deductible as opposed to a PPO plan)
            it is pretax and 
            This is technically the most tax advantaged account that I know of
        </p>

        People dump on
        if you buy an ETF, you need to concern yourself with the div

        1 bp = 1 basis point = 1/100 of a percent

        https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VTI

        https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/vtsax

        Mutual fund VTSAX has 4 basis points of fees a year, while the equivalent ETF VTI has 3 basis points of fees a year.

        If you have 1 million dollars, if will be an additional $100 a year.
        If you have a serious amount of money though (in the millions)

        The ones I picked are dictated by my broker, who offers low fees for certain ETFs. just pick what is cheapest for you.
            Large cap US (SPY, IVV, etc)
            Small cap US (IJH, IJR, etc)
            International established (EFA, IEFA)
            International emerging (VWO)
            REITs
            US treasuries (IEF, IEI, etc)
            Investment grade corporate debt (LQD)
            High yield corporate debt (HYG, JNK)
        You could probably make do with 1-4,6. Or just VTSAX/VTIAX as is common in FIRE communities
